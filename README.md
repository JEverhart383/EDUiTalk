# EDUiTalk
This repo contains some project files for my talk at EDUi 2015 "Evolving Beyond Excel: Interactive Data Visualizations with HTML, JS, and SVG."

##Initial Set-up
1. Download repo as .zip file and extract contents
2. Load index.html file using some server (MAMP, WAMP, Python, Node)
3. Follow along with the steps outlined in the code comments

###Getting Started 
We're going to get started creating a simple scatterplot using [D3 (Data Driven Documents)](http://d3js.org/). Be sure to check out the D3 documentation for specifics that go beyond what is covered in this talk: 

We will also be taking a look at the [DimpleJS](http://dimplejs.org/)library. DimpleJS extends D3 and provides higher order functions so that we can easily use popular charts.
